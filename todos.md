# Engineering Todos

## Keyboard & Ergonomics
- [x] Experiment with **Hold Tab for Alt** (and Tap Tab for Tab) to improve AeroSpace ergonomics.
    - *Context*: Reaching `Alt` with thumbs on the 14" MBP is uncomfortable.
    - *Tool*: Karabiner-Elements.
    - *Status*: Implemented in `feat/karabiner-setup`.
- [x] Configure **Esc to English**: When the `Esc` key is pressed, automatically switch the input source to English (U.S.).
    - *Context*: Useful for Neovim users who type in multiple languages to ensure they are in English when entering Normal mode.
- [x] Refine **Caps Lock** behavior:
    - Current: Caps Lock -> Control (via macOS system settings).
    - Future: Tap for `Esc`, Hold for `Control` (via Karabiner).

## AeroSpace
- [x] Tighten window gaps to 5px.
- [x] Add workspace rotation bindings (`alt-[`, `alt-]`).
- [x] Route Google Chrome "Google Chat" tabs to Workspace C.
